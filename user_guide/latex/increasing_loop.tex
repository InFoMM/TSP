The increasing loop algorithm is a stochastic algorithm which produces a possible solution for the travelling salesman problem, which will most likely not be optimal. However, the algorithm is constructed to hopefully provide near optimal solutions, and possibly some optimal, over a small set of runs, although it is not guaranteed. The hope is that this scheme is a reasonable compromise between execution time and optimality.
