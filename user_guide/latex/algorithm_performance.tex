\section{Algorithm performance}
\label{sec:algorithm_performance}

We have two classes of algorithms, those which compute exact solutions, and those which compute approximate solutions. Those which compute exact solutions are accurate but may take a long time to execute, whereas the approximate solutions may be quick to run, but may give routes which may not be optimal (although possibly close to optimal). With any algorithm a compromise between execution time and accuracy has to be met, and so  depending on the need of the user, we present some characteristics of the algorithms available.
